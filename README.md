Version 1.0 is finished. There are a few built in themes, as well as integration with "Everything" for easy and quick search of your programs.

You can either build and run this yourself, or you can navigate to and launch df_out\DesktopFolders Version 1.0\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\DesktopFolders.exe
